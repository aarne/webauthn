  Server->>Browser: Please send me a public key, <br>here is a challenge (nonce)
  Browser->>User: `webauthn.register(...)`

  User->>Browser: New key pair created
  Browser->>Server: Send public key credential

  Server->>Browser: Account created
```

The registration process occurs in four steps:

1. The browser requests a `challenge` (a nonce) from the server
2. The browser triggers `client.register(...)` and sends the result to the server
3. The server parses the JSON payload, verifies it, and ensures the `challenge` matches
4. The server stores the public key credential for this device for the user account

Note that unlike traditional authentication, it is often useful for a single user account to register multiple credentials passkeys.


### 1. Requesting challenge

The challenge is basically a [nonce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nonce) to avoid replay attacks.

```
const challenge = /* request it from server */
```

Remember it on the server side during a certain amount of time and "consume" it once used.

### 2. Trigger registration in browser

Example call:

```js
import { client } from '@passwordless-id/webauthn' 

const registration = await client.register({
  /* required */
  user: "Arnaud Dagnelies",
  challenge: "A server-side randomly generated string",
  /* optional */
  authenticatorType: "auto",
  userVerification: "required",
  timeout: 60000,
  attestation: true,
  debug: false
})
```

### 3. Send the payload to the server

> By default, the native WebAuthn protocol does not result in a serializable object. The protocol in its third iteration provided a `toJSON()` function but its support is not widespread. Moreover, decoding this response would still need decoding CBOR server-side.
>
> Because of this, this library decided to return a more convinient format instead. Plain JSON not requiring CBOR libraries server-side.

The result `registration` object looks like this:

```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": "7f26f9ab-4fbc-4103-807f-ed145acb7ecc",
    "name": "Arnaud",
    "displayName": "Arnaud"
  },
  "credential": {
    "id": "3924HhJdJMy_svnUowT8eoXrOOO6NLP8SK85q2RPxdU",
    "publicKey": "MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAEgyYqQmUAmDn9J7dR5xl-HlyAA0R2XV5sgQRnSGXbLt_xCrEdD1IVvvkyTmRD16y9p3C2O4PTZ0OF_ZYD2JgTVA==",
    "algorithm": "ES256"
  },
  "authenticatorData": "SZYN5YgOjGh0NBcPZHZgW4_krrmihjLHmVzzuoMdl2NFAAAAAAiYcFjK3EuBtuEw3lDcvpYAIN_duB4SXSTMv7L51KME_HqF6zjjujSz_EivOatkT8XVpQECAyYgASFYIIMmKkJlAJg5_Se3UecZfh5cgANEdl1ebIEEZ0hl2y7fIlgg8QqxHQ9SFb75Mk5kQ9esvadwtjuD02dDhf2WA9iYE1Q=",
  "clientData": "eyJ0eXBlIjoid2ViYXV0aG4uY3JlYXRlIiwiY2hhbGxlbmdlIjoiYTdjNjFlZjktZGMyMy00ODA2LWI0ODYtMjQyODkzOGE1NDdlIiwib3JpZ2luIjoiaHR0cDovL2xvY2FsaG9zdDo4MDgwIiwiY3Jvc3NPcmlnaW4iOmZhbHNlfQ=="
}
```

Then simply send this object as JSON to the server.

### 3. Verify it server side


```js
import { server } from '@passwordless-id/webauthn' 

const expected = {
    challenge: "Whatever was randomly generated by the server",
    origin: "http://localhost:8080",
}
const registrationParsed = await server.verifyRegistration(registration, expected)
```

Either this operation fails and throws an Error, or the verification is successful and returns the parsed registration.
Example result:

```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": "7f26f9ab-4fbc-4103-807f-ed145acb7ecc",
    "name": "Arnaud",
    "displayName": "Arnaud"
  },
  "credential": {
    "id": "3924HhJdJMy_svnUowT8eoXrOOO6NLP8SK85q2RPxdU",
    "publicKey": "MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAEgyYqQmUAmDn9J7dR5xl-HlyAA0R2XV5sgQRnSGXbLt_xCrEdD1IVvvkyTmRD16y9p3C2O4PTZ0OF_ZYD2JgTVA==",
    "algorithm": "ES256",
    "synced": true
  },
  "authenticator": {
    ...
    "name": "Windows Hello",
    "icon_dark": "https://webauthn.passwordless.id/authenticators/08987058-cadc-4b81-b6e1-30de50dcbe96-dark.png",
    "icon_light": "https://webauthn.passwordless.id/authenticators/08987058-cadc-4b81-b6e1-30de50dcbe96-light.png"
  },
  ...
}
```

The credential's `synced` variable indicates if the corresponding *private key* is a "multi-device" key, typically synced in the cloud, or a "device-bound" key, typically stored on a dedicated hardware chip.


> **NOTE:** Currently, the *attestation* which proves the exact model type of the authenticator is *not verified*. [Do I need attestation?](https://medium.com/webauthnworks/webauthn-fido2-demystifying-attestation-and-mds-efc3b3cb3651)

### 4. Store the credential key

The credential key is the most important part and should be stored in a database for later since it will be used to verify the authentication signature.

```json
"credential": {
  "id": "3924HhJdJMy_svnUowT8eoXrOOO6NLP8SK85q2RPxdU",
  "publicKey": "MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAEgyYqQmUAmDn9J7dR5xl-HlyAA0R2XV5sgQRnSGXbLt_xCrEdD1IVvvkyTmRD16y9p3C2O4PTZ0OF_ZYD2JgTVA==",
  "algorithm": "ES256",
  "synced": true
},
```

*Please note that unlike traditional systems, you might allow a user to have multiple credential keys.
For example, if you allow the user to use multiple device-bound keys and/or registering keys for multiple platforms.*


Options
-------


Besides the required `user` and `challenge`, it has following options.

| option | default | description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `hints` | `[]` | Which device to use as authenticator, by order of preference. Possible values: `client-device`, `security-key`, `hybrid` (delegate to smartphone).
| userVerification | `preferred` | Whether the user verification (using local authentication like fingerprint, PIN, etc.) is `required`, `preferred` or `discouraged`.
| `discoverable` | `preferred`. If the credential is "discoverable", it can be selected using `authenticate` without providing credential IDs. In that case, a native pop-up will appear for user selection. This may have an impact on the "passkeys" user experience and syncing behavior of the key. Possible values are `required`, `preferred` and `discouraged`.
| timeout | `60000` |  How long the native authentication popup stays open before aborting the authentication process.
| attestation | `true` | Whether or not to provide "attestation" in the result. The attestation can be used to prove the authenticator device model's authenticity. Note that not all authenticators provide this (looking at you apple), it might be anonymized, and its verification is complex.
| domain | `window.location.hostname` | This can be overriden for two use-cases. By using the parent domain, to have the passkey valid for all subdomains. Or by using the outer domain when using iframes. 
| debug | `false` | If true, the parsed payloads will be included in the result.





### Replacing a credential or updating the user name

Regarding the `user`, you can either provide a name as string, or an object like `{id: '...', name: '...', displayName: '...'}`. By default, `name` and `displayName` will be the same. The `id` should not disclose personal information as it can be exposed. Providing the ID can be used to override a credential with a new one, including an updated `name`/`username`.
